## WHAT’S INCLUDED IN OUR FREE EVENT TICKET MANAGER FOR WOOCOMMERCE PLUGIN: 

**1) Ticket Stock Management**
The ticket stock represents nothing but the number of seats available in your event. The merchant can manage the stock of the tickets from the admin panel. You can also see how many tickets are sold and track if you are running out of stock. 

**2) Set Location For Events With Google Map**
Provide a high-level view of your offline events by showing the exact location of events to the user in the frontend. The plugin is integrated with Google Maps that lets WooCommerce store owners show the live location of the events on the store.

**3) Download Tickets As PDF**
The WooCommerce Events Ticket Manager allows the customer to download the tickets as PDF for offline use. When customers buy tickets for an event from your WooCommerce store they send an email with a pdf attachment of the ticket. The customers can also download the ticket from the **My Account tab.** 

**4) Events Calendar**
The plugin comes with a calendar widget that shows your customers a list of upcoming events. With the help of this widget on the sidebar, it makes it easy for customers to spot the scheduled events.

**5) Reporting With Multiple Views**
The Event Tickets Manager for WooCommerce gives the store owner a detailed report with multiple views:

  * Event-wise
  * Attendee-wise 

With the event-wise view, the admin can analyze which event tickets are sold the most. This gives you an in-depth version of what is liked by your audience so that you can have more such events in the future.

The attendee-wise view shows you the customers that bought tickets in your store. You can give special discounts to customers that are regular participants of your events

**6) WPML Multilingual Support**
The plugin comes with WPML multilingual support, so as to say, the WooCommerce extension will work in your local language. You can also use the Loco Translate Plugin to translate the string in your local language.
